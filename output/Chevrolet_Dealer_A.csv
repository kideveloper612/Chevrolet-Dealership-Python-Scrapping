Bottom line pricing appears on all cars, so there is no price haggling. There was no pushing. The shoving was from my husband and I who had to say we want to buy this car. No papers were shoved in front of us, no second person  came to talk us into anything. It was calm and informative. A carfax was given to us and we could see the care that was given to the truck. My husband knew when tires were installed. So the paper work goes to the office. It took an unusually long time, but when the ""closer"" came back to us he had a much lower interest rate than our own bank would give. He explained the different maintenance plans, and respected out choice. Deal done, we took our new used truck home.  Excellent experience.",Chris Jacobs,5,Doug Atkinson,5,,,,,,

I came to Gandrud because of a television ad, for used Chevy Cruze's. It was -1 degree outside, and as I drove around the lot in my warm truck, here comes Antonio! It was so cold, I made him get in my truck, and we discussed why I was there and what I was looking for. We drove around for a few minutes, then went inside to review all of the choices (there were a lot of them). He took me step by step, through features, colors, etc, and we narrowed it down to just a few so that we could spend less time outside looking at all of them. Needless to say, I said good bye to my old truck, and drove home in my new used car. If you go there, I recommend asking for Antonio! He has a great outlook, and was positive the entire way.

I wanted to make sure I was well informed before hitting the lots to deal with a pushy salesman. I dreaded the idea of getting talked into something more than what I wanted. David Burns did the exact opposite of what I was expecting. He was professional and easy going. He didn't bombard me with information or questions. He allowed me to control the tempo of my shopping experience. David treated me as an equal and respected all my quirky questions about vehicle options. He provided the details and allowed me the time to process the information. When I returned  2 weeks later with a specific vehicle in mind he was there to help me get through the purchasing process. David made himself available to help with any vehicle related questions even a few days after the sale.

Mike L. worked nonstop to find us a car that met our needs and Jay Cooper killed it with helping us get a loan and monthly payment that was good for us. We had some credit issues but Jay killed it and got us within dollars of our monthly payment target. The professionalism and dedication to help their customers is beyond what we could ask for. My wife and I are very happy we walked out of another dealer and walked into this one. What a different experience with these guys. We will be returning for our future purchases. Thank you Mike and Jay for everything you guys have helped us with.,Michael Lindgren,5,,,,,,,,

Michael Lindgren took time to show me more than one vehicle that would be appropriate for me and provided excellent customer service. Mr. Lindgren worked with Wahid Amani and Jay Cooper and was able to guide me through getting the financial approval I needed to finance a safe,  reliable preowned vehicle. This vehicle has very low mileage and was maintained impeccably by its previous owner.  Within a very short period of time from walking into the dealership I was able to walk away feeling more than satisfied with my experience. I highly recommend  this dealership to anyone who wants to have the experience I described above.  Finding the right car is stressful enough, when you have great customer service and attention to what your needs are it makes the process so much easier.

Right  from the start he made me feel comfortable and although I was unable to do anything right then, he continued to maintain contact.  Since it was the end of the month, Mike really wanted to make a deal. He, along with his manager Jay Cooper, worked tirelessly to make it happen.  Mike ended up finding me a newer model (2017 Traverse), with half the mileage and AWD, which is what I really wanted.  I can't thank him enough for getting me my dream car!  Millenium Chevrolet has a customer for life.  A shout out to Wahid Will Amani for getting me through all the necessary paperwork, which was thoroughly explained to my satisfaction.
